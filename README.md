# JavaScript Problem-Solving Practice

## Description

This repository contains my solutions to a set of JavaScript problems that I practiced to improve my coding skills in JavaScript. I aimed to solve these problems within a span of three days to enhance my understanding and proficiency in JavaScript.

## Problem Set

### Day 1: Basics and Problem-Solving

- Write a function that returns the nth Fibonacci number.
- Create a function to check if a number is a prime number.
- Reverse a string without using the `reverse()` method.
- Write a function that finds the largest element in an array.
- Implement a function that sorts an array without using built-in methods.

### Day 2: DOM Manipulation and Mini Projects

- Create an interactive to-do list with add, delete, and mark-as-done functionality.
- Build a basic calculator with HTML buttons for numbers and operators.
- Make an image carousel/slider that changes images automatically or on user interaction.
- Develop a simple quiz application with multiple-choice questions and a scoring system.
- Implement a form validation feature for a basic login or sign-up form.

### Day 3: Asynchronous JavaScript and Algorithms

- Create a function that makes an API request using Fetch and displays the data.
- Write a function that uses Promises to handle a chain of asynchronous tasks.
- Implement a binary search algorithm to find an element in a sorted array.
- Develop a sorting algorithm (bubble sort, selection sort, or insertion sort) and test it with an array of numbers.
- Build a function that performs a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) on a graph or tree structure.
